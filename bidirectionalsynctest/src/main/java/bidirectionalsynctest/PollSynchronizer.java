/**
 * This class objective is to create a critical area around the application in
 * order to stop that two what ever threads access the area if other is in it.
 * 
 * A semaphore initialized to one, and which is used such that it only has at
 * most one permit available, can serve as a mutual exclusion lock. This is more
 * commonly known as a binary semaphore, because it only has two states: one
 * permit available, or zero permits available. When used in this way, the
 * binary semaphore has the property (unlike many Lock implementations), that
 * the "lock" can be released by a thread other than the owner (as semaphores
 * have no notion of ownership).
